The people who are rating this game 'ZERO' for it only allowing one island are missing the point entirely, it's a feature intended for investments of familiarity. People expect every game these days to have every feature they've wanted from every game. The game excels on making your island feel like YOUR slice of paradise away from home. To dilute the game with multiple journeys defeats the point. Your visitors are treated as such because it's your town.Anyway, this is the Animal Crossing game to get stuck into. It's a masterful work of comfort and relaxation, should you be a fan of magical simulation games, this is an obvious buy.… Expand	2020-03-20"

My wife has about 8 hours in the game, I have about 6.Sharing an Island thoughts:So far we both find it excellent and have had no issues with sharing an Island.  I should qualify the review by stating that I played the GameCube version extensively and put some 80 hours into the 3DS version so I haven't played all iterations of the game.  Still, I have no issues with two people sharing an island as long as the primary player initiates it so player 2, 3 and 4 aren't held back.I always enjoyed the shared experiences of animal crossing.  How one player would teach the computer characters specific words.  You and your siblings arguing over who ran over all the flowers.  Competing to get rare fossils first.  To me that was the fun of the game.  Personally, I think so long as you aren't a control freak this is more fun forcing multiple players into a shared space.Actual Game Review:I love it.  To anyone who has played the game before this is a natural progression.  If you feel you are ready for a new instalment it appears to have everything you would want.  If you haven't played before you need to be prepared for what the actual game is.  Professional reviews would describe it more articulately but it is a basic communication game.  This may sound like one of those mobile games where you have to play every few hours to harvest stuff and trade things but the design predates that genre by several years.

Wild World only had one town per cartridge. City Folk had only one town per system. And

I would have rated this game 9/10 for its slow start and lack of camera freedom, but I'm rating it a 10/10 to counterbalance all the reviews that forget to actually review the game and its merit rather than a single one of its flaws. I do not believe that a game so fun, heart-warming, charming, and immersive should receive such a low user rating solely because it doesn't specifically tailor to your needs. I can acknowledge the problem, and sure it really sucks, but it isn't representative of literally everything else about this game.

You don't get to name the island, you don't get to build the structures on the island and you don't get to contribute to most of the story which Animal Crossing has to offer.My brother who is the Citizen Representative enjoys the game and it is really polished and has a nice gameplay loop, but I feel ripped off.

The big pros introduced in this game that I see clearly are the introduction of crafting, innovations to both indoor decorating and new outdoor decoration, and freedom to build your town how you like it with the moment of buildings introduced. There are many other pros too, such as character customization, the beauty of the game (especially seen in the museum), etc. However, the game does have flaws. The tool degradation feels like complete annoyance rather than sense of progression and challenge it should, which is only worsened by the crafting system lacking depth due to the only 8 or so crafting  materials ever used. This makes it feel very monotonous to craft things, as it would require more resources than your small island can provide, which leads you to go to other islands (Using "

There is no shared progression toward islandThis review is written from someone who shares a console with other users, so the review will reflect that experience. Sharing a single island amongst several other players is seriously disappointing, and leaves much to be desired. Progression and game features are severely limited to anyone who doesn't play as the primary island inhabitant. There is no shared progression toward island milestones, and key items or crafting abilities are not distributed in the same manner, leaving an imbalanced playing experience. Players who are not the first to set foot on the island are demoted to mere scavengers of resources, with limited contribution to island development. The choice to not have separate islands for separate players, and to limit the developmental experience for players that share the island, is highly disappointing, and appears to be the greatest complaint with the game.  It became very apparent that this was a poor system wheat the point in the game where the first set of new inhabitants are joining the island and the primary player is given some dozen new crafting recipes and the objective of placing and furnishing several new homes across the island. Secondary players during this timeframe get none of the same recipes, are merely told to talk to the primary resident for instructions, and cannot contribute in any way to the progression aside from collecting raw materials like mindless robots.

It feels like I'm going to have done everything there is to do within a month.And that doesn't even touch on the multiplayer nonsense. You're limited to one island per console, so player two doesn't get a full experience. Player 1 controls the island, every other player is just a permanent visitor with very little control. If I hadn't started the game the same day as my girlfriend and waited a week or so to start playing, I'd be dropped in a deserted island full of houses, people, and businesses.Don't bother buying unless you plan to be the only one playing.… Expand	2020-03-24"

I’ve always been a huge animal crossing fan as well as my mum, playing since Wild World. I have been so excited for this game for so long, which couldn’t have come at a better time btw. The game is visually amazing and there is so much more flexibility, more challenges and more to do. Placing items inside and outside, the crafting and customisation mechanic, choosing where villagers live, terraforming and waterscaping which are available later on are all unimaginably amazing features and really let you customise your island. Being able to play with 7 other friends is amazing, I have made huge use of this feature, having a large amount of friends who also play the game and this has enabled me to feel less isolated as well. I don’t understand why people complain about only being able to have one island, me and my mum have always had 2 characters on the same town and absolutely love it. We can customise ourselves and homes individually as well as sharing many experiences, such as working together to complete the museum donations etc and doing things for each other when the other is absent. The amazing thing now is that 2 people can play on one system at the same time, which is something we could never do before and I have absolutely loved doing this! People who say for 2 people in the same house to play together you need 2 switches, that’s simply not true at all. In the past this was true as you could only play one at a time and would need 2 3ds and local play, but now this is not needed as you can much more easily enjoy playing together as well as apart. People who leave 0/10 reviews obviously have no clue what they are talking about and can’t appreciate how great this game is and how many amazing editions have been made -crafting, customisation in seconds, placing everything where you want, changing your whole island layout, being able to pick up entire trees and move them, being able to expand your inventory, new hairstyles and facial features that you can change when you want much more flexible pro designs- can now make hoodies and different types of dresses etc and more!! The villagers are so much more lifelike as well.

Just like player 1, they had to slowly and painstakingly put time into the game to get to the points you're complaining about.I understand the one island per switch, but there's two reasons for this.First, an island takes up a significant amount of space on your switch. With the addition of progression and adding items to your inventory, and your museum and encyclopedia, that all adds up. Then imagine every user on a switch, 8 users with their own individual islands, on top of that per user, 7 additional houses per shared island. That's a grand total of 8 unique islands, and 64 unique players. That amount of data adds up, quickly.Secondly, adding onto the data situation. The game allows 8 users total on an island. If you're playing online, the max is 8 on your island total. Given the switch has a total of 8 users, its the best choice to make. One island per switch, one player per user.To review bomb a game means you aren't taking time to understand and come to terms why the game is built like this.Overall, in my opinion, the game is a 10.

I will not be focusing on the multiplayer aspect, as I am playing alone on my Switch, and am not encountering problems, though I can totally understand the frustration of those who have to share a console/island. The game is built unfairly for those people.The game does not have hourly music, which is something previous Animal Crossing games are known for. I miss having quirky, hourly tracks, but the backtrack gets repetitive very quickly. The objective based system is a nice touch, but unfortunately doesn't feel rewarding, and does not lead to any larger objective. Gyroids also are not present in the game, and I REALLY hope they come out with an update.The game has a slow paced system, which is OK and echoes the Animal Crossing feel, but the delay of introducing characters/villagers/buildings/etc leads to a heavy lack in content. Who knows, maybe they weren't expecting people to have so much time due to the Corona lockdown! I am a bit disappointed that I'm already starting to feel bored after 4 days, especially when the game has been in the making for such a long amount of time.I'm hoping a lot of these problems will be fixed by either playing the game for a longer period of time, or updates.

I also have some things I don't necessarily like. Like how you can not access information on the critters you have already caught. You have to catch it again and ask Blathers about it. It gets a little annoying with bugs. I'm hoping I'm just not far enough in game and there's going to be an encyclopedia app on the nook phone.Also  sometimes I get caught on a barrier around houses and trees and it looks like I'm stuck moonwalking for some reason. A lot of people don't like that you can only have one islands per switch but I don't personally mind. I created new accounts so I could do a themed island based on the Odyssey. When Odysseus was on the goddess witch Circle's island. I understand that if your playing with siblings and you don't want then to mess up your island or vice versa it can get annoying. I hope that maybe for those of you who have issues they will release an update that allows you to choose on your profile if you wish to join the residents of an existing island or forge your way on your own island."

Unlocking new recipes, buildings and islanders gives a sense of progression I didn't think the game would have, and it's pretty cool seeing the island grow more and more each day that passes.… Expand	2020-03-25"

The other person just runs around with minimal objective and less opportunities. If you are a solo player you will very much enjoy the game, otherwise- don’t spend the money.	2020-03-25"

The current system lets player 1 get the full game, with all other players only objective is to complete nook miles.Worst part is there was not even a warning at the beginning of the game letting the players know that the first person to play gets full control.

Effort was definitely made on this game. I can tell that there are different types of things to do in game. However I almost guarantee that I will never get there. For now, I really like the game. For now. Multiplayer is awful, I bought it so my wife and I could enjoy something fun and it turns out that second player is just one person as the leader and the other follows them around pretty much unable to do anything but pick stuff up. Pointless and not worth setting up in the first place. As far as online goes I won't even bother trying it. Having 8 people able to draw off of my already dismal material sources at anytime just isn't feasible. Iron nuggets are hyper rare at best. I get one on average for every two days I play. I think the idea behind this is to encourage online play.At first I was super excited, this is a new and unique concept to me. I don't predict I am going to care enough about it to play more than a week or so. I have a situation in which I need a tiny number of iron nuggets and at the pace I'm going I'll have flat gotten tired of trying. You can spend certain currency to go to vacant islands and take supplies, but you will only get so much of that currency so if you don't think before you spend you will find yourself in short supply and only able to get a bit every day.The whole game appears to be geared towards tiny amounts of play time. At an hour every day I have ran all but the most common resources out. Even weeds no longer spawn on the parts of the island I can reach. If I have two inventories of high value items to sell, the second inventory (And so on) always seems to sell for substantially less which means it becomes annoying trying to grind for money.Tools that last require resources that I can't afford to spare if I want to progress the game, so I am currently unable to craft them. This was a terrible oversight at best. I've resorted to making cheap tools over and over again and have ultimately found they are more cost efficient in the long run.I can't recommend this game. I will continue to hang in there and update my review for as long as I can hold my attention on the game but again I doubt I'll even still keep it downloaded on my switch past a week or two.Don't buy it.… Expand	2020-03-25"

There are problems, but most are not nearly as pronounced as some make them out to be. DIY being the main gimmick puts the control directly into your hands, so you get to build the island in the most literal way possible. Certain construction projects still require you to wait a day before getting to use it, but that's nothing a little time travel can't fix. Time travel, though I personally don't like it, circumvents most problems that come with how this franchise's progression works, and while some people just want to max out their town as soon as possible, animal crossing has only ever worked when there's something important to do. When you complete everything, what else is there? So, if not for this flaw that all animal crossing games suffer from, it'd be a 9/10. Only having one island per switch is annoying, yeah, but at the same time, is it really a reason to give a rating that should be reserved for games like Sonic the hedgehog (2006), or crappy movie based games like shark tales?

Do keep this in mind before buying if this is important.The other issue I have with this game is the first week or so. It's sloooow. Even for an animal crossing game. It was kind of tempting to time travel at a few points. If you pick up the game, stick it out until the upgraded resident services building is built. It does pick up from there.As far as negatives go, that's all I got. "

The issue is that any other account on the system that plays AFTER the first person to open the game is FORCED to play a lesser experience that happens to be shackled to the multiplayer experience. It is then not an equapl, stand alone playthrough with all the features of one.A lot of reviews are fair in their scores because they played the full game with no problems on one account. That is fine. But a lot of people have more than one account on their Switch. To say that the opinions on the game by people affected by this are unfounded is frankly ignorant and it doesn't address the core problem.It's 2020 and we can't have multiple accounts play their own instance of a game?

Well, here is the first issue. You can only have one save game, one save slot, one island  in the entire console. You are forced to share the island with the other users  playing in your console. You change something in there, amd it will change for everyone on that console as well.  A bit crappy, because there is a lot of people that preffer to put dedication or enjoy to play alone or just preffer to not have their kids messing with the island and the things youve done but it can be tolerable. Except its not. Because the game implements a system where the first player or user that plays the game, is a leader that consists of granting progression lock to all other users. What do i mean? It means that if the leader player hasnt played trough some part of the game, no one else can ...  it hears like a joke, like, havent you thought the leader player could just abandon the game and force everyone to get stuck? Or just not play as often and delay the hell out of the other users? This game seems promising, but so many stuff limit you for no reason whatsover really, who thought it would be neccesary to force everyone to share one single save game, and at the same time lock the progress to all users except the one who first booted up the game? Yeah, because its not the user who bought the game but the one who plays it first. And yes, you guessed it, there is no way to change this leader player unless you delete all save game data and let the game as new and unplayed. Too many issues to be enjoyed just by a fatal saving system that nobody likes or understands why it was made that way.… Expand	2020-03-26"

My girlfriend was just as excited to try this game as I was when we got it, so you can imagine the disappointment for both of us when we discovered how there can only be one island. As player 1, I spend most of my gameplay feeling guilty and feeling bad about making decisions that she’s not allowed to participate in or trying to balance between wanting to do everything but not wanting to take all the resources from her. As player 2, she spends the gameplay basically just being a visitor to the island, never able to make any actual changes or shape the island how she really wants. She’s also locked out of many little tasks (such as helping Gulliver). This simple mechanic that would be easy to fix in an update has truly ruined the experience for both of us. The fact that "

I made an account just to review this game. Because of my disappointmentI am a solo player who was entering this franchise for the first time. So the single island per console thing doesn't effect me, but in an era where other games can have as many procedural generated worlds as people can fit on their console hard drive...that makes absolutely no sense. And these islands are tiny.My first impression of this game is that it forces you to play it how IT wants you to. I have repeatedly changed my in game clock on my switch just so I can progress the game, and when you consider that you can hit the first time gate in 40 minutes, it puts you in an awkward position where your first day of the game is just shaking tree's and catching bugs and fish while trapped in the starting area. I felt like I was playing an early access title.What's worse is you are punished for your progression initially. You get locked out of content because the game decides you've done enough of it and then doesn't let you back into that system for 48 real world hours. At one stage you are not allowed to buy key items used in repeatable achievements because you are playing the game at the wrong REAL WORLD time. And this makes no sense when you consider the first version of the shop is available 24-7.The control mapping is bizarre, the tool system, which is arguably the most important system in the game is bound to the D-pad instead of the back buttons, which is annoying when you consider that fast moving insects exist in this game and you have to stop moving to swap to your net. Also the phone being bound to ZL instead of + symbol makes no sense..The + symbol is only used to access a specific menu in the phone...The central buttons on a controllers are universally used for key menus in most modern games so why was this an exception?To further add to the clunky issues with the game, the shop system puts filler dialog in everything, and only allows you to buy items in 1's or 5's, while some repeatable achievements require 3 of the item, so you either buy 5 to save time, or buy 3 increments of 1 just to save money. I don't know if future upgrades to the island make this simpler, but if that's the case, why on earth would game designs make players have to unlock intuitive design?If not for the returns policy of the retailer I bought this at, I would already have returned it. I will continue to play my $69AUD investment to the endgame and may change my review depending on how the mid-late game is.… Expand	2020-03-26"

This is frustrating because the developers know very well that half (if not more) of the players playing the game will time travel anyway, so refusing to make it an in-game mechanic seems like stubbornness. A lot of time is wasted when you have to save, close the game, go to system settings, change the time and re-open the game every 30 minutes just to advance to the next day.2) As I had feared when the game was announced, the game sadly is not worth the $60 price tag, no matter how you split it.

I am appalled at the idea of forcing all owners of the switch onto one island where only one player has full control over progression while others fight over the limited daily resources. How unbelievably stupid was that decision? I know many will argue that this is how Animal Crossing games have always been. So? That doesn't make the decision good. For instance, Breath of the Wild was an instant hit in my household. This could not be the case if everyone was locked into the same save. Instead, everyone had their own save and could make their own decisions. Scratch that with Animal Crossing. My younger sister was eager the play after me, but couldn't find anything to do after 5 minutes. For a second player, this game deserves a 0/10. This stands true until every individual profile has the option to tend to their own individual island. It just ruins the experience. I hope these negative user reviews open "

Please add a feature of some sort where you can choose an option in Red Text three days in a row to get a villager to leave. People are going to time travel anyways.-Playing multiplayer with friends should not take so long each time to have someone come into your island. It's disrupting. The individual player should see the traveling screen, and then just pop a notification when it's been loaded into their friend's island.-You can only play one profile per Switch. Same console multiplayer isn't fun. Split-screen or individual menus would have been better, as well as not having only one person who can make decisions. It's a family console - Resident Representative should be a shared title, so they can all move things the way they want, or even have their own islands and use Call Resident to play them on the same island but keep menu functions.-"

Quality gameplay, unique characters, not overly complicated.  Just an enjoyable game.  For anyone who has played the original Animal Crossing on the gamecube you will probably be the most upset.  Because you probably played with family members at the time, and enjoyed the minor multiplayer setup it had back then. This version has somehow managed to ruin even that minimal multiplayer functionality from back then.The trade off I suppose is that they enabled an okay form of online play.  But when it comes to Animal Crossing the most enjoyable way to play was with others locally who could setup shop in the same town.They would be able to progress the town if you weren't there, interact with the town folk, the folk then mention them in dialogue the next time you play.  And you really felt like you were living in the same town/area.  You'd be excited to see the what changes they made next or upset that they beat you to it.  But hey, that's life.  Well now that 2nd, 3rd, 4th player cant progress the story, or help new residents move in.  Some DIY creations are kept from them.  And it downright sucks to be that person.  Multiplayer is a huge part of this game which is why I'm giving it a 6 star.  Last quick bit on their online play: it is okay.  At least each person will get their own screen there. But it's not optimized and obviously hasn't gone through any QA testing.Animal Crossing is one of my favorite games so this is why I'm taking the time to write this review.  Ultimately my personal thought is they royally messed up this game by not putting really any more than an ounce of thought into the multiplayer aspect.  But again the series is great, the concept is great.  Ultimately they added some interesting content to the game now.  I'm excited to see what they add in future updates!  Edit:  P.S. Sadly the local multiplayer issues are enough to where I had to tell my brother to return the game.  As he was hoping he'd be able to play it with his wife.  And once I told him about the issues he was in complete agreeance.  It's just not worth buying the game for that.  Worth pointing that out, because this isnt just some little mistake.

It defeats the purpose of why I wanted the game to begin with. I'd even consider buying another copy of the game if I could get my own island, but that's not an option either.I'm really disappointed, and I guess I'm just not going to play it until my husband gets tired of it.

It really pains me to give this game a low rating because honestly it does so many things right.  In truth, this game would definitely earn a 9 or 10 out of 10 were it not for one glaring issue.  The fact that the game limits you to one island per console.  This is bad for so many reasons that countless others have already pointed out. Obviously it means that multiple people are limited to sharing a single experience instead of being able to have their own separate adventures.  But that isn’t really why I am so frustrated by this game.  "

It’s a fun game but the multiplayer options for this game when played on the same Switch are ridiculous and warrant a 0 rating. Only the “primary” player (the first player on the island) is able to progress through the storyline and complete certain quests. I’ve been running around the island for three days now and I can’t get an axe to progress further because the primary player of the game has lost interest already and hasn’t opened the axe up in their game. So I have to either log in as them and play as them and do these things or quit. I choose to quit the game. This is a ridiculous way to design a game. I find it mind boggling that developers sat down in meetings during development, discussed this, and decided it was a great idea.  Then that great idea was coded, tested, and still made it into the final cut. How does something like this get implemented?  Have these developers ever played a multiplayer game?  Who actually thinks like this?  Who wants to play a game and be eliminated from content just because they are not the “first” player of the game?  Who tested this feature and liked it?  It’s just dumb game design, period.I have asked for a refund, not sure if it will be approved but the request has been made.… Expand	2020-03-31"

This all has been very frustrating since my Fiance hasn't had much fun playing alongside me. The game itself has some odd mechanics too. Fishing and digging are hard as hell. There is no indicator that you are facing the right direction so most of the time you end up missing your target. Crafting items is a **** and a half. If you want to craft multiple items, you have to click to craft, watch the animation, then click back in to craft again. Repeat until you build as many items as you want. Super time consuming and annoying. All tools will break eventually, and I wish there was a durability indicator so you are aware when it will break. I do enjoy this game while playing alone, but it's a real bummer that we can't have our own separate islands and have equal participation. If that gets fixed and the other minor things change, I'll be happy with the game, but for now, I am disappointed.… Expand	2020-04-01"

When upgrading or moving houses it literally calls inthe box for a useless conversation about moving.3.any interaction with new box is a time sink.4. The game doesn't give you an option to have fasted dialog. 5. You need to go through the dumbest receptive dialog when accessing stores or the nook system.This game is honestly not as seamless as it should be.When placing down trees or buildings you get no indication whether or not it's going to fit. And if it does and its not aligned as you want it you have to re do the dialog to place again. Why is there no outline indication. I really enjoyed the start but as the game progresses and there's more stuff to do. 2 hour useless npc talking and A button smashing is getting annoying. Going to fly in the airport? Yeah wait 1122 years for the stupid dodo to shutup.Wanna craft multiple items? You wish there was a craft X amount. "

The sheerThis was my first time diving into this cherished franchise and I must say all my hype and excitement was very much matched. The atmosphere of this game feels exactly like a vacation, a place you can get away and enjoy life however you want. Catching fish, planting flowers, visiting new places, a museum, and shopping, all while meeting adorable animal friends along the way. The sheer amount of stuff you can do in this game is insane, to a point that a completionist like me wonders if you can really do it all, not that it'll stop me from trying! Then the social element with friends makes the experience even better, as the communication with hunting bugs and fish, different stuff to craft, or even the stalk market all make you feel like you're apart of something larger as a whole (even lager than the feeling of your own island community gives you). That's exactly the feeling the developers want you to have with this franchise, and it certainly resonates within each and every one of us. And even simplified, visiting islands and showing off your own is just fun! (So long as everyone plays nice)This was a time in my life when this game was exactly needed, and has brought me so much joy and peace. I know I'll be playing this game for months and years to come, and even when the next Animal Crossing game comes out, "

Create more of a city, involve more on your island. I just feel it's so limited for not really a good reason but to be a cop out. I'd love more interaction with the citizens and events with them. Everything seems so bare bones for a $60 game.I'd also enjoy it if you had sort've a function to treat it like stardew valley where it had it's own hastened day/night cycle to an extent. I'd like to at least play the game in a few weeks, enjoy all there is to see  and catch/do quests for everyone in that time frame. It's just not there, just nooks increasing debt with everything you do. I get that animal crossing may just not be for me however, I don't think a lot of what I said are bad idea's nor would make people dislike the game any.

You get gated after 5 donations to Tom then  after 15 more donations to Blathers, which is then followed by a mandatory 24h construction period.

Clicking through 8 dialogues, watching an obnoxious cutscene that also plays for ALL other players in the island you go to and not being able to do basic things when your island is open for other players.- The speed at which tools breaks, even the improved ones.

And frankly this makes no sense, in fact it goes against their online subscription business model where you can either buy for an individual or family (8). Clearly one console is designed to be used by many users so why aren’t the save features of this first party title. This review comes from 2 people with 1 switch.

Unfortunately there are no separate save files, so he has to play on an island that I control, where I have already picked over all of the resources. Any subsequent players get no money, no resources and no control. This is not a family friendly game.	2020-04-09"

My main gripe is the same as everyone else reviewing this game poorly - the decision to lock each Switch to one island.

Reading about the functionality for multiple players now, though, I don't feel like it's even worth inviting someone else to play. It seems like a lot of features, even beyond being able to place buildings and such (which it makes sense to restrict to one person), are missing for succeeding players.So if you're alone, this is a great game.

Yeah, you don't like it, I get it.  People are getting hundreds of hours of entertainment from a $60 game.  There is literally nothing else in life that gives that much money-to-entertainment ratio.  Even the cost of another Switch factored in (plus all the other games you'd play on it and be entertained by), it is still a great deal.  The single island thing is definitely a cash grab move, but is still better than most companies doing the micro-transaction thing.  The hours of entertainment involved with modern systems/games far outweigh the cost involved (when compared to other types of entertainment, such as movie theaters or dinner or theme parks, etc etc).Actual criticism about the game itself:I don't like that when you BUY stuff you get a chance to buy something else without restarting the conversation, but when you SELL stuff, you can sell that one thing and then have to start the conversation over.  Only a minor annoyance, though.I wish that in the out-of-doors, you could get an idea of where you're about to set an item down (and how big of a space it needs).  You spend a lot of time guessing and then getting an alert that there isn't space there.  In time, you get a better idea.  Again, just a minor annoyance.… Expand	2020-04-12"

In fact have one island per switch is the best part, I have 3 other people on the same island and it is nowhere near crowded. having 3 of my siblings makes it feel more like home, being able to trade and help the rest of my family makes the game even more personal. it even got my mom interested interested in video games and overall has helped my family grow closer.

However, I have a lot of other disappointments. I won’t go over the things I love because the critics covered it all—everything they said is definitely true. This is by far the best Animal Crossing yet, despite the huge flaws. I’m very disappointed to see that there’s no way to access your storage outside of your home. The storage is much better than before, don’t get me wrong—you can store much more, and the game auto-sorts your stuff for you. Character customization and clothing customization is far better than ever. But when you add crafting, several things need to be changed. Even in previous games, you could access your storage through either the post office or train station. Considering you can place items which used to link to your storage (dressers, chests, etc) out in your island now, why can’t you use those to access storage? I know this wouldn’t be “realistic,” but Animal Crossing isn’t exactly about realism. The multiplayer is clunky as hell, too. Connection has been pretty bad every time I play, and the longass animation whenever people join or leave is AWFUL. If you want to play with more than one friend at once, you’re out of luck. "

I get that it's not designed to take hours of your time daily, but I felt on the first day that it was just extremely empty and it was quite off-putting. Then I began questioning my decision to buy the game; fortunately, there is more to do in the next days.Some criticism comes from the click A-fest that occurs during some conversations. Some people defend it by saying it's a part of the game and it helps the immersion. Well... I would agree if the dialogue would get switched up and I wouldn't need to repeat four choices after getting an error or missclicking the last one. Unfortunately, there is no variance and no new lines. Everyone just keeps repeating their own spiel. Doing things like museum donations or flying to another islands gets super tedious and annoying rather fast. The constant interruptions in multiplayer don't add to the charm either. Read that as: the multiplayer in this game is completely atrocious and utterly useless.Content wise the game is good and I feel there is still more for me to uncover.

At the same time correct and incorrect. This is from a time travellers perspective though.For time travellers they are able to skip to any day of the year and be able to catch fish/bugs that are meant for that time of year. Games come out so frequently nowadays that you could end up forgetting you even have Animal crossing to play when another game comes out that your absorbed into. So being a time traveller you can put so much time into the game so quickly and be able to get as much possible from it without having to do so much waiting. I Time travelled and i sunk in an easy 100 hours doing stuff and enjoyed most of it. From doing all this i found some stuff that could affect a casual non TT playthrough.The waiting days has been in since the begining but in this game its next level, theres alot more you have to wait days to do. Which means alot less of being able to play while waiting for these. Everything is IRL time based, so its not even like you can spend time trying to finish your collections because you have to wait for that during times of the year. So combining it all it just makes less to do rather than more. Its more over time, this game is perfect for you if you can only sink in a couple hours a day. Its really not even hard to get money in this, so you can do everything you need to do in a couple hours each day. Theres no more burrying your shovel to get golden either with this new recipe thing, so you now have to do something that comes randomly each week and you have to do it 30 times. Which is another you having to wait day by day to check if that persons there. The amount of waiting you have to do has been increased by around double, which imo isnt a good thing as like i said games come out alot and you can just end up forgetting about your island. I never felt like this in the past couple of games and they still had all this in, just less of it.The local multiplayer really needs some work for the next game, should be two completely different save files and only join each others island if your both logged in at the same time and P1's island is the one you go to. I don't really local multiplayer though so this doesn't really affect me as much.All that really comes down to this is there is just alot more waiting in this one and for someone that wants to spend 10 hours on this with a day off work. You are going to get bored as the game is constantly at a dead end. Someone that can only fit in a couple hours a day this is perfect for you.… Expand	2020-04-16"

I thought to myself after a while what even is the point?i start my morning by just water my flowers which with the bad controls takes a long time. then I chop some trees and pick fruits. by then i'm so exhausted and bored that I don't even bother with anything else. there simply isn't much to do. Stardew Valley leaves a lot to explore and do!the controls aren't nice. I don't like how you have to wait for the flowers to sparkle to tell if they're watered . with a lot nearby it's not a nice way. a lot of the mechanics like donating to the museum feel so unrewarding. I feel no reason to do it. unlike stardew valley that I donated every first of any item I got there.stardew valley is simply 20x better and costs less than half as much when not on sale.it started of very fun but they haven't managed to make the tasks rewarding. there's just something about the animations the speed of them and the rewards that you get for them that makes this game not fun. and I LOVE games like this. farming stuff and the type where you get stuff and unlock more new stuff. this is my fav genre of games so it's not a I only like call of duty kind of issue, They just haven't made it work well for me.

From the perspective of someone who's played every game in the series since the DS, I can also vouch for this one is easily the best.Aside from some minor inconveniences and one really major inconvenience I'll get to in a minute, this game's new ideas shine. There's a lot of quality-of-life changes, but in typical Animal Crossing fashion, it's still kinda bad. For example, you don't have to worry about waiting for furniture to show up in the store because you can craft them as many times as you want whenever you want, so long as you have the materials to do so. But you can't craft the same thing in bulk, so if you have 19 manilla clams, you're gonna have to wait through 19 animations and select the options 19 times. It's not a huge deal, but it's a bummer. It's still not easy to time-travel, which I understand makes me automatically the worst person on Earth and the bane of some Tumblr users' existence, but it really should be made much easier to allow people to play the game the way they want to play it. Especially since the solution to not being able to sell things after the stores close is... not good. It's bad. It sucks. You just have to wait until the shop opens to get 80% of the bells you would've made if you'd just waited until the morning to hand it to the shop owners directly, so it completely misses the point. But again, it's really not that big a deal.That stuff holds it back from a perfect 10 out of 10, but the good absolutely outweighs the bad here.

You aren't pressed for time and can do what you want. I spent my first two weeks catching a wide variety of creatures to fill the museum, creating my own house and trying to make money.However, I then spent the next two weeks doing the exact same thing.You need allot of money to progress in this game, so you're going to have to go catch creatures and craft items to sell. Once you upgrade your house you are then presented with another option to upgrade (progress in the game, essentially) so you'll have to go catch creatures and craft items to sell so you can get another upgrade and do the same thing again and again.This isn't just limited to the main game either, filling out the museum requires you to spend hours catching fish and bugs over and over and finding fossils (you have high chances to keep getting creatures and fossils you've found before).The character dialogue? repeating. You start to notice the same dialogue being used over and over after about a week or so of playing, and while that may be fine normally this is a game that's supposed to be some sort of long term investment and is praised for its supposed 'small details' and charm, which I found ran out after the first week as the game kept trying to repeat the same tricks over and over to try and impress and engage me. This game is essentially a one trick pony, after the initial 'wow' there's not much left to be impressed by.Its fun at first but everything about this game screams repetition, its more like a chore than a fun game.I can't really recommend this game, its not the worst game I've ever played, but its just dreadfully boring.… Expand	2020-04-20"

Personally I am OK with just having the one island, however, the management side of things should have been extended to all players and not just the first one.This does not ruin the game completely and it's still a great successor to the series. Hopefully the devs can constructively move forward with an update that allows people to start easier. I wish I had known this limitation on launch day, but we stayed away from too much info so we didn't spoil the initial fun and no one wants to reset your stuff after a few days of work already got put in.The community of designers is pretty awesome and both my wife and daughter love customizing their homes with the shared designs.… Expand	2020-04-27"

Little by little you improve your island and your house and soon garner villagers to populate your village. You can pull weeds, catch bugs, fish, dig for fossils, design clothes, flags and a great many other things. It does get a bit repetitive, but is fun for me nonetheless.

Only 1 Island ambassador can make major decisions about the island... per Switch console, not account. This leaves all other accounts on the console playing this game unable to progress the story.

Considering there's still only 4 personalities for each gender, the only reason to ever get attached to a villager comes down to how they look, not really what they say.The reason I'm mixed on this game an' maybe the series as a whole is that I wish there were more activities to do instead of the same fishin', bug catchin', shell collectin', fossil huntin', an' flower planting. With all these decorations in the game, you'd think you could interact with more than a handful of 'em in an interesting way. To shorten my review a bit, I think Jim Sterling sums it up pretty well in his jimpression of the game.Even though I don't have anyone who I share my Switch with that also plays the game, I can understand those who wanna have their own separate island between accounts an' it must be really frustrating to deal with.I don't like local multiplayer at all but online multiplayer is generally much better.

"7	nightstroller	To be super honest without even considering the one-character restriction, this game is overhyped. Yes the atmosphere is relaxing and the graphics are cute, but this game for some reason doesn't really make me want to binge play it. Maybe it was designed like that on purpose, with rocks and resources spawning daily once tapped. But overall, this isn't a game I would stay up playing. "

I understand the aim of the game is to fill your island with consumer goods to raise it's 'rating' but it really just feels like someone raided the unity asset store for free models; very few things are aesthetically pleasing.Interactions, menus, inventory etc feel unintuitive (to me);i) 'drop' should not be the top item on the inventory menu.ii) I want to be able to shake a tree for fruit even if I'm holding a spade without it trying to (ineffectively) dig up the tree.iii) Many sub menu interactions kick you out of the whole menu/inventory after doing one thing, e.g. unequip a hat, and if you want to do anything else (unequip more etc) back into the inventory you go.Dialogs/Messageboxes are WAY too verbose and always on; most games with chat dialog may have a verbose version the first time, and then a terse version from then on, not AC. Every time you talk to a shop keeper you get the whole 4 or 5 dialog box spiel you have to click through (even pressing b to speed things up it's still a chore), want to post a few presents to friends? *Every* one requires you to read 'hmmm, it looks like they have a postcard rack, maybe I could...' - 'who do you want to send it to?' - 'connecting to the internet' -etc, and when you're done, do you go back to the previous menu for more?

I don't think the developers tested the game cuz if they did, they'd realize how tedious and boring so many of the aspects are. Also after you unlock terraforming, you can only break or build one thing at a time and the animation takes about two seconds per block. It took me half an hour to make some simple waterfalls and cliffs when it would have taken a fraction of the time if I didn't have to sit through the annoying animation for every block. They easily could've made it so we could break or build multiple things at once but like I said, it feels like the devs intentionally made the game super tedious cuz they thought it would be relaxing which it's not. It's annoying and they would realize if they played the game for more than 2 seconds. The villagers are also boring. In AC on the GameCube, the villagers had personality, felt different and wouldnt immediately treat you like a best friend. In this game, they all basically say the same stuff, they're all overly friendly and they no longer have chores for you in exchange for furniture. On top of that, they rarely interact with items or furniture which they do better in Pocket Camp. That's right, a $60 game has worse villagers than a free mobile game. Also 1 island per switch is the worst move I've seen from "

The core gameplay is nothing too different from the usual game. Little improvements to the game, like actually having the option to move your home / being presented with a multitude of crafting recipes for decor is very welcome. The number of villagers possible to meet (and invite) is astounding! While not every villager makes a comeback in the game, but a number of characters last seen in the original Animal Crossing finally make a return in this game after not appearing in earlier games.I do find fault with the one island per console thing, but... I think that has been overly addressed to the point where  My main issue with the game is the UI / Camera Layout.Listen, I'm fine with not being able to rotate my camera outside of my house. It really isn't needed. What is needed, however, is the ability to look top-down. Way too many times have I missed a glowing spot because they're hidden behind a building or something. It's great that you've included it with the end-of-game mechanic, which isn't to be named for spoiler warnings, but I think it should become part of the core game mechanic.The DIY crafting menu sucks, and so does the inventory menu. Let's say you're trying to craft items to sell because they make a ton of bells. Sure, you can mash A to speed up the crafting process, but what if you don't want to stress out the button you already spam for fishing? Gotta fork up some money to buy a controller with turbo, or something. I'd much rather have the option to craft multiple items at once. Speaking of multiple items at once, it also wouldn't hurt to change how people divide stacks in your inventory. You need to select the item, and select grab one in order to move separate something from a stack, but only at one at a time. It'd be great if we could indicate how many we would like to separate from said stack to save on time. Also worth mentioning, but I don't think the game's worth $60. I don't have a reasoning behind this, but... I think $50 might be a more appropriate price.With all of that said, I'm not dropping the game. I love it and will keep playing it. It sucks that my little sister can't play the game too, but since I am playing this single-player... I'm fine with this. Hopefully, they can repatch the game to support multiple players in the near future.TL;DR:Pros:- Similar enough to older games- Able to finally move your home.- So many villagers to meet, some returning for the first time in a while!Mixed:- Crafting is cool but kinda tedious.Cons:- Camera angels are kinda annoying to hold.- O"

Luckily that doesn't really affect me, or I would have had a real problem with this game. It would also be good if you could play couch co-op with full functionality for the second player. The second player can't really do much. There are also some problems that should be fixed such as being able to craft multiple things at once.

The only ones that ask to leave are ones that I actually like. So that's just been pretty annoying for me. I also feel like there are several things that could have been added that would have made the game more rewarding in my opinion.

This may be getting a little too complicated though, but it's just my preference. Another thing is it's very rare that the villagers or Tom "
